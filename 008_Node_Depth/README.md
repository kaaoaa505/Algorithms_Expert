# Node Depth Algorithm

- The node depth in a tree refers to how far a node is from the root node. 

- The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the root. 

- The root node has a depth of 0, its children have depth 1, their children have depth 2, and so on.

# Example Tree

        A
       / \
      B   C
     /   / \
    D   E   F

# The depth output would be:

A -> 0  
B, C -> 1  
D, E, F -> 2
