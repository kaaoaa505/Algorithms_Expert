# 🔍 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 
- It's typically implemented with recursion or a stack.

# 📌 How it works:
- Start at the source node.
- Visit a node, mark it as visited.
- Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors.
- Backtrack when needed.

# Example
         A
        / \
       B   C
      / \   \
     D   E   F
