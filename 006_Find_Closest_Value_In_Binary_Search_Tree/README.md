# To find the closest value to a target in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
- you can use a simple recursive or iterative traversal while keeping track of the closest value seen so far.

# Problem
- Given a BST and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

# ðŸ§  BST Property Reminder:
- Left child < node < Right child
- So, we can move left or right depending on how the target compares to the current node's value.
